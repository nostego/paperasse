\summary{
  %general intro on dimensionality reduction

  The purpose of a speaker verification system is to check whether a
  hypothesized speaker is really the author of a speech utterance.  In
  the LRDE's speaker verification system, a speaker is represented by
  a 600-dim vector and the speaker verification score is computed
  thanks to a cosine distance between two vectors representing two
  different speakers.


  This paper describes a dimensionality reduction technique called
  Spherical Discriminant Analysis (SDA) in the context of the LRDE's
  speaker verification system.  The goals of this projection is to
  maximize the cosine distance between different speakers; it has been
  shown that SDA subspace yields superior performance in a speaker
  clustering task especially with a cosine distance scoring
  function. This paper will compare the SDA subspace performance with
  the Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA) which is
  currently used in the LRDE's speaker verification system.}
%Introduce context: speaker verification, ivector, find a better subspaces
%SDA is similar to LDA but with a cosine distance.
%SDA Goals are:
% - to maximize the within class cosine similiarity (aka minimize cosine distance)
% - to minimize the between class cosine similarity (aka maximize cosine distance)
% Has been shown that the cosine distance is betta
