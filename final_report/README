EPITA Research and Development Laboratory,
instructions for compiling technical reports.

* I. Requirements:
* ================

** Tools:
** ------

- GNU make (other version don't work with these makefiles).
- LaTeX2e  (for latex, dvips, pdflatex)
- texi2dvi (this executable is part of makeinfo).

Depending on the presentation's figures, if any, and on whether you generate
dvi, ps or pdf, you might also need fig2dev, epstopdf, dia and ImageMagick's
convert program.


** LaTeX packages:
** ---------------

Here are the required packages, along with their minimum release dateL

- geometry 2002/07/08
- inputenc 2001/07/10
- fontenc  2001/06/05
- palatino 2002/09/08
- hyperref 2003/01/22
- fancyhdr 2002/12/09
- babel    2001/03/01 (for presentations in french; there should be none :-)
- graphicx 1999/02/16


* II. Compilation:
* ================

- ps and dvi versions are generated in the ps/ subdirectory.
- pdf versions are generated in the pdf/ subdirectory.

`make' alone generates ps and pdf version. Otherwise, you can use the
following specific targets: ps, pdf, or switch to the desired subdirectory and
just type `make'.

* III. Notes:
* ===========

techrep is enforcing latin1 option for inputenc
(M-X set-buffer-coding-system iso-8859-1 in emacs)
